      "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \"For Whites Only\". We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n",

      "Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\n",

       "'I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation   Five score years ago  a great American  in whose symbolic shadow we stand today  signed the Emancipation Proclamation  This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice  It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity   But one hundred years later  the Negro still is not free  One hundred years later  the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination  One hundred years later  the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity  One hundred years later  the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land  So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition   In a sense we have come to our nation s capital to cash a check  When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence  they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir  This note was a promise that all men  yes  black men as well as white men  would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness   It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned  Instead of honoring this sacred obligation  America has given the Negro people a bad check  a check which has come back marked  insufficient funds   But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt  We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation  So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice  We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now  This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism  Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy  Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice  Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood  Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God s children   It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment  This sweltering summer of the Negro s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality  Nineteen sixty three is not an end  but a beginning  Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual  There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights  The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges   But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice  In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds  Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred   We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline  We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence  Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force  The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people  for many of our white brothers  as evidenced by their presence here today  have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny  They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom  We cannot walk alone   As we walk  we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead  We cannot turn back  There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights   When will you be satisfied   We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  We can never be satisfied  as long as our bodies  heavy with the fatigue of travel  cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities  We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one  We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating  For Whites Only   We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote  No  no  we are not satisfied  and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream   I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations  Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells  Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality  You have been the veterans of creative suffering  Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive   Go back to Mississippi  go back to Alabama  go back to South Carolina  go back to Georgia  go back to Louisiana  go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities  knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed  Let us not wallow in the valley of despair   I say to you today  my friends  so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow  I still have a dream  It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal    I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood   I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi  a state sweltering with the heat of injustice  sweltering with the heat of oppression  will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character   I have a dream today   I have a dream that one day  down in Alabama  with its vicious racists  with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification  one day right there in Alabama  little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers   I have a dream today   I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted  every hill and mountain shall be made low  the rough places will be made plain  and the crooked places will be made straight  and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed  and all flesh shall see it together   This is our hope  This is the faith that I go back to the South with  With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope  With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood  With this faith we will be able to work together  to pray together  to struggle together  to go to jail together  to stand up for freedom together  knowing that we will be free one day   This will be the day when all of God s children will be able to sing with a new meaning   My country   tis of thee  sweet land of liberty  of thee I sing  Land where my fathers died  land of the pilgrim s pride  from every mountainside  let freedom ring    And if America is to be a great nation this must become true  So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire  Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York  Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania   Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado   Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California   But not only that  let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia   Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee   Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi  From every mountainside  let freedom ring   And when this happens  when we allow freedom to ring  when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet  from every state and every city  we will be able to speed up that day when all of God s children  black men and white men  Jews and Gentiles  Protestants and Catholics  will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual   Free at last  free at last  thank God Almighty  we are free at last   '"
